# School Bus Routing: Exact Optimization vs. Scalable Heuristics

An optimization research project for the **School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP)**. The project studies how to build feasible bus routes while balancing operational efficiency with a less visible objective: fairness in students' in-vehicle time.

Rather than treating SBRP as a single-solver exercise, I implemented an experimental framework that compares exact optimization, decomposition, and metaheuristics

## Problem

Given student demand at multiple pickup stops and destination schools, construct routes that:

- serve every student and deliver them to the correct school;
- respect bus-capacity and maximum-route-duration constraints;
- minimize fleet size, total travel time, and student in-vehicle time; and
- avoid systematically giving students from the same school disproportionately long rides.

The weighted objective used throughout the project is:

$$ \min\; w_b \cdot \text{buses}
+ w_t \cdot \text{travel time}
+ w_r \cdot \text{in-vehicle time}
+ w_f \cdot \text{fairness penalty} $$

This formulation makes the central research question explicit: **how much efficiency should be traded for a fairer distribution of student travel burden?**

## My Contribution

- Built a shared route simulation and feasibility layer so every solver is evaluated under the same capacity, duration, demand, and fairness rules.
- Implemented **Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition with column generation**, including reduced-cost pricing and fairness-aware route generation.
- Developed scalable **Greedy, Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization, and Large Neighborhood Search** solvers.
- Combined column generation with an **LNS pricing heuristic** to explore the middle ground between exact optimization and practical scalability.

## Results & Engineering Takeaways

The experiments expose the expected but important optimization trade-off:

- **Exact optimization** provides a quality reference for smaller instances, but exhaustive feasible-route generation becomes the scalability bottleneck.
- **Metaheuristics** give up optimality guarantees in exchange for the ability to search larger instances within a practical runtime.
- **Column generation** avoids enumerating every route upfront, while heuristic pricing further improves scalability when exact pricing is too expensive.
- **Fairness is not free**: changing its weight can alter route composition and travel time, so it must be evaluated alongside cost—not added only after routing.

The figure above summarizes the 9/20/35 groups experiments. It is intended as an empirical comparison of solver behavior, not a claim that every heuristic reaches the global optimum.

## What I Learned

- A mathematically stronger formulation is not automatically the best engineering solution; the useful method depends on instance size and runtime budget.
- Exact solvers are valuable beyond deployment: they provide baselines for measuring heuristic quality on tractable cases.

## Implemented Methods

| Method | Role in the project | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| Exact optimization (Gurobi) | Small-instance benchmark | `exact_solver.py` |
| Dantzig–Wolfe / column generation | Decomposition-based optimization | `dantzig-wolfe_solver.py` |
| Column generation + LNS pricing | Scalable route-column discovery | `dantzig+lns_solver.py` |
| Large Neighborhood Search | Destroy-and-repair local search | `lns_solver.py` |
| Genetic Algorithm | Population-based search | `ga_solver.py` |
| Ant Colony Optimization | Pheromone-guided constructive search | `aco_solver.py` |
| Greedy construction | Fast baseline and initial solution | `greedy_solver.py` |

## Data Format

Each instance consists of two CSV files:

- `stops-*.csv`: pickup-stop ID, original matrix index, destination school, and student demand.
- `time-*.csv`: square origin-to-origin travel-time matrix covering stops and schools.

Each solver prints a solution summary including objective cost, bus count, total route time, total in-vehicle time, feasibility, and route details.
